**MAIN RULES**
- Keep everything **Java 1.8** and **Gradle 6.4.9** compatible.
- Make sure to take your time and focus the users requests and think deeply: quality over quantity
- Use a tasklist
- Enforce micropattern corrections: `*ALOAD` for ArrayReader; Looping via **dominator back‑edge**; `Exceptions = ATHROW`.
- Distinguish **α_mp** (micropattern blend) vs **τ_accept** (final match threshold).
- Freeze and document the **17‑bit order**.
